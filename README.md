## Reference

This project is based on the paper **[FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering]** by Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalenichenko, and James Philbin. The paper introduces a deep learning model for face recognition and clustering using triplet loss.

## Disclaimer

This project is not intended for production use. It is a personal project aimed at improving my understanding of machine learning concepts and the PyTorch framework. Contributions and suggestions are welcome to help enhance the learning experience.

## Triplet Loss

Triplet loss is a key component of the FaceNet model. It works by minimizing the distance between an anchor and a positive sample (same identity) while maximizing the distance between the anchor and a negative sample (different identity). This ensures that embeddings for the same identity are closer together in the feature space.

## Model Architecture

The FaceNet model uses a deep convolutional neural network to generate embeddings for face images. These embeddings are optimized using triplet loss to ensure that similar faces are clustered together in the embedding space.
